## Description

_The Bagel Store App provides a simple and streamlined solution for those in need of bagels. A user may add their preferred type of bagels with their preferred toppings to an order, and once submitted, keep track of their order. A bagel provider can look through orders customers have placed, and mark them as ready. In order to mark an order as completed, an exchange must take place between producer and customer where the customer provides the producer with a special code. At this point the transaction will be marked complete, and payments will settle._
